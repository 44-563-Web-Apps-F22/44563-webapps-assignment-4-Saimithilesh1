                               CHORUS
                       "Death to the Invader!"

Chorus:           Death to the invader!
                   Strike a deadly blow,
             As an old Crusader
                   Struck his Paynim foe!
                         Let our martial thunder
                         Fill his soul with wonder,
                         Tear his ranks asunder,
                               Lay the tyrant low!
             Death to the invader!
                   Strike a deadly blow,
             As an old Crusader
                   Struck his Paynim foe!
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <br>

Melissa:          Thus our courage, all untarnish'd,
                   We're instructed to display;
             But to tell the truth unvarnish'd,
                   We are more inclined to say,
             "Please you, do not hurt us,"
             <br>
             <br>

All:                    "Do not hurt us, if it please you!"
<br>
<br>

Melissa:          "Please you let us be."
<br>
<br>

All:                    "Let us be — let us be!"
<br>
<br>

Melissa:          "Soldiers disconcert us."
<br>
<br>

All:                    "Disconcert us, if it please you!"
<br>
<br>

Melissa:          "Frighten'd maids are we!"
<br>
<br>

All:                    "Maids are we, maids are we!"
<br>
<br>

Melissa:          Please you,
<br>
<br>

All:                    Do not hurt us;
<br>
<br>

Melissa:          Please you,
<br>
<br>

All:                    Let us be.
<br>
<br>

Mel & Cho:        Frighten'd maids are we, frighten'd maids are we!
<br>
<br>

Melissa:          But 'twould be an error
             To confess our terror,
             So in Ida's name,
             Boldly we exclaim:
             <br>
             <br>

Mel & Cho:        Death to the invader!
                   Strike a deadly blow,
             As an old Crusader
                   Struck his Paynim foe!
                   <br>
                   <br>

<span style ="color:red">(Flourish.  Enter Princess, armed, attended by Blanche and Psyche.)</span>
<br>
<br>

Princess:    I like your spirit, girls!  We have to meet
        Stern bearded warriors in fight to-day;
        Wear naught but what is necessary to
        Preserve your dignity before their eyes,
        And give your limbs full play.
        <br>
        <br>

Blanche:                            One moment, ma'am,
        Here is a paradox we should not pass
        Without inquiry.  We are prone to say
        "This thing is Needful — that, Superfluous"—
        Yet they invariably co-exist!
        We find the Needful comprehended in
        The circle of the grand Superfluous,
        Yet the Superfluous cannot be brought
        Unless you're amply furnished with the Needful.
        These singular considerations are—
        <br>
        <br>

Princess:    Superfluous, yet not Needful — so you see
        The terms may independently exist.
(To Ladies)       Women of Adamant, we have to show
        That women, educated to the task,
        Can meet Man, face to face, on his own ground,
        And beat him there.  Now, let us set to work;
        Where is our lady surgeon?
