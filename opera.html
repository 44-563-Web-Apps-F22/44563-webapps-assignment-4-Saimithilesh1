                            <h5> CHORUS</h5>
                      <p> "Death to the Invader!"</p>

 <h5>Chorus:</h5>  <br>      <p> Death to the invader!
                   Strike a deadly blow,
             As an old Crusader
                   Struck his Paynim foe!
                         Let our martial thunder
                         Fill his soul with wonder,
                         Tear his ranks asunder,
                               Lay the tyrant low!
             Death to the invader!
                   Strike a deadly blow,
             As an old Crusader
                   Struck his Paynim foe!</p> 
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   <br>

<h5>Melissa:</h5> <br>     <p>  Thus our courage, all untarnish'd,
                   We're instructed to display;
             But to tell the truth unvarnish'd,
                   We are more inclined to say,
             "Please you, do not hurt us,"</p> 
             <br>
             <br>

<h5>All:</h5>    <br>             <p>  "Do not hurt us, if it please you!"</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>Melissa:</h5>    <br>    <p> "Please you let us be."</p> 
<br>
<br>

<h5>All:</h5>        <br>           <p> "Let us be — let us be!"</p> 
<br>
<br>

<h5>Melissa:</h5>     <br>     <p> "Soldiers disconcert us."</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>All:</h5>         <br>          <p> "Disconcert us, if it please you!"</p> 
<br>
<br>

<h5>Melissa:</h5>     <br>     <p>"Frighten'd maids are we!"</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>All:</h5>         <br>         <p>  "Maids are we, maids are we!"</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>Melissa:</h5>     <br>    <p>  Please you,</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>All:</h5>        <br>           <p> Do not hurt us;</p> 
<br>
<br>

<h5>Melissa:</h5>     <br>    <p>  Please you,</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>All:</h5>         <br>         <p>   Let us be.</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>Mel & Cho:</h5>     <br>      <p>Frighten'd maids are we, frighten'd maids are we!</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>Melissa:</h5>   <br>    <p>     But 'twould be an error
             To confess our terror,
             So in Ida's name,
             Boldly we exclaim:
            </p> 
             <br>
             <br>
<h5>Mel & Cho:</h5>    <br> <p>  Death to the invader!
                   Strike a deadly blow,
             As an old Crusader
                   Struck his Paynim foe!
                  </p>
                   <br>
                   <br>

<p>(Flourish.  Enter Princess, armed, attended by Blanche and Psyche.)</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>Princess:</h5> <br> <p>   I like your spirit, girls!  We have to meet
        Stern bearded warriors in fight to-day;
        Wear naught but what is necessary to
        Preserve your dignity before their eyes,
        And give your limbs full play.
